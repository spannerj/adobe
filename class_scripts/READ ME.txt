Add the Process_Class.jsx file to C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CC 2014\Presets\Scripts
Add all the other .jsx files to C:\Adobe\scripts

You will need to start with a folder structure like:

School/Edited/

All the class jpgs should be directly in the Edited folder. 

When you run the Process Class script from PS you should see an 'Online by' and a 'Return by' edit box to enter your dates in.
Also make sure the first time you run it the sub folders check box is checked.

Once you have run the script and it should look like the Example school set up.
The only difference is the folder names haven't changed yet.

I haven't massively tested it but it's 3.30am and I think it's working. Give it a go and if it isn't i'll fix it tomorrow night.
